# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

## 🩺 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based solution for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the notebook demonstrates how medical image data can be processed and analyzed to support healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia.

## ✨ Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Handles X-ray images and prepares them for model training with appropriate augmentations.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a CNN architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Training Pipeline:** Implements training and validation routines, including callbacks for monitoring performance.
- **Performance Visualization:** Plots training and validation metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- **Evaluation:** Provides metrics and visualizations to assess model performance on test data.
